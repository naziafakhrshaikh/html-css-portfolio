        <p>
          My story begins in April 1981 in Lahore, Pakistan where I, the youngest of seven children, was born to lively house full of love, noise, and the adorable chaos.When I was about five, we moved to Islamabad, and shortly after that my father left for the United States, in search of a way to support his family and provide a better life for all of us. For years, we grew up with letters, occasional phone calls, and the hope that one day we would all be together again.
        </p>
        <p>At thirteen, that long-awaited day finally came and we reunited with my father in America. But only my mother and the 3 youngest daughters were allowed to come. We were just struggling to adjust to the new enviroment when one day, only three months later, everything changed. I woke up to my mother's screams for help while she was trying to lift my father off from the floor. He had suffered a major brain hemorrhage. One moment he was laughing with us, and the next he was in the ICU, unconscious for four days. When he finally woke up, he could talk anymore, had impared memorie and decision making power, his right hand and leg couldn't move, and his mouth was droped on one side. This was the first time in my life I had seen someone become ill and admitted to hospital. This taught me lessons far beyond my age: endurance, acceptance, patience, and a strange kind of strength that only comes from surviving hardship. </p>
        <p>We were suddenly three young sisters under twenty-one in a new country, with little English, no money, and absolutely no idea how the American system worked. My mother was struggling physically herself, and everything felt overwhelming. After he was discharged, we simply couldn’t survive — emotionally, financially, or physically — so we returned to Pakistan. I dropped out of 8th grade and tried to adjust again. I struggled socially, academically, and emotionally, but life wasn’t done teaching us resilience yet.
        </p>
        <p>My father’s health kept declining in Pakistan. We couldn’t find proper treatment, and doctors advised us to take him back to the U.S. My older brother tried to get early immigration visa but was denied permission. So my 19-year-old sister, barely an adult , took my parents and flew back to America with no money, no experience, no medical knowledge, no place to go, and no guidance. She faced a country she barely remembered, with a sick father who couldn’t walk, talk or even think properly. Somehow, with God's help, sheer courage, she figured everything out. She got him into treatment, found support, and them afloat. That chapter alone could be a movie.
        </p>
        <p>I had to stay in Pakistan, away from my mom for almost 2 years, first time ever since I was born. I completed my schooling in Pakistan and eventually returned to America after graduating to reunite with my family. By now my sister had a full time job and a rented home. I enrolled in Norwalk Community College to continue my education. I discovered programming there and felt a natural connection with it — something about solving problems and seeing instant results excited me. I studied several subjects including Java, HTML, C++, Visual Basic, and SQL, along with a computer logic courses. Those classes gave me my first taste of real coding, and I enjoyed it so much that I often stayed late in the computer lab just to practice. Balancing studies with life was not always easy, but those years made me realize that I belonged in the world of technology. If life hadn’t taken so many turns, I probably would have continued in that field long ago — but deep down, the love for it never left.
        </p>
        <p>My first real job was at Propark Parking in Stamford, a place that became an important chapter of my life. I would go to college in the morning and walk thirty minutes to my job in the evening and on weekends, rain, snow, sun, everything. I was the youngest employee there and the only one attending college, so everyone treated me like a little sister, especially my manager. He trusted me with office-related tasks like doing paperwork, entering customer information in the computer, making reports, organizing files, and helping with small administrative duties. I also attended the booth, handled cash, and interacted with customers on daily basis. That job wasn’t a glamorous, but it was my first step toward feeling the weight of responsibility, patience, and the value of earning my own living.
        </p>
        <p>One weekend, a customer who was still under the influence demanded that I open the gate for him without paying his parking fare for the night before. I tried to explain the rules, but he got aggressive, started cursing, and before I could react, he stormed forward and broke the wooden arm of the parking gate. I was terrified and totally shaken. But I calmed myself, called my manager and explained the situation. For the rest of the day, I had to use a traffic cone to control the exit. On another day, a customer called for a shuttle pickup from the train station. I forgot to notify the driver because he was in route. I had to wait for him to come back but since I was very busy, it slipped my mind. When he called again, I realized my mistake, I felt terrible. When he arrived, he was angry and yelled at me. I knew it was entirely my mistake, I handled the situation respectfully, apologized sincerely, and made sure it didn’t happen again. From then on, I started to write it down on post it notes to remind my self.  These moments taught me patience, responsibility, and the importance of staying kind even when dealing with stress, confrontation, or my own errors. They helped shape the way I interact with people to this day.
        </p>
        <p>I also took up a job at Norwalk Community College. I became a student assistant mainly because long gaps between classes made it difficult to travel back and forth—especially with no car, long walks to bus stops, and tiring bus rides between cities. Working in the front office kept me on campus and occupied in something useful.  I helped new students register, print schedules, transcripts, and answer basic questions. The beginning of each semester was chaotic but exciting, with lines of students and constant activity. Even though I was just assisting my lead coworker, it felt good to be part of the college community and learn how things really worked behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>In year 2000, my family decided to move from Stamford to Pennsylvania. I enrolled at Delaware County Community College, but many of my credits didn’t transfer and the IT program was different from my current major. A year later we moved back to Stamford, and most of the credits I earned in Delaware College were lost,  another small setback I had to work through.
        </p>
        <p>At Delaware College, I worked as a Lab Assistant where I was responsible for helping students operate the computers and printers, solving small technical issues, and keeping the lab organized. I learned how to troubleshoot basic hardware problems and guide students who were new to the equipment. It was a simple job, but it made me feel useful, confident, and connected to the learning environment.
        </p>
        <p>After graduating college, I got married in 2005 in Pakistan. It opened a new chapter in my life and I had transit from a young student to a married adult. I returned to the U.S. after a few months and got a summer job with the Stamford Board of Education. It was back in the time when they were just switching from paper to digital meal applications. I was hired as a temp to  lead the project. For the first time ever, I found myself supervising a team of 10–12 temp workers. Together we organized packets, mailed documents, and created lists.  Later I had to sort through hundreds of returned applications. I created my own system to check forms, group families, handle incomplete applications, and assist parents who came in person. It was a lot of responsibility for my first job, but I enjoyed the independence and the trust they placed in me.
        </p>
        <p>Later, a more experienced coworker was assigned to help me, but she felt it insulting to follow my lead. She acted cold, and continuesly reminded me she was more experienced. This caused a mix up in applications. When files went missing, she refused to admit it, and blamed it on me.  Despite the frustration, I stayed calm, respectful, and organized. I found the files and also adapted to the situation. At the end of the project, my manager told me he had been considering me for a permanent role—something that meant a lot to me, especially after the challenges.
        </p>
        <p>It had been almost a year since my marrige, yet I had no idea when would my husband be able to come to the US. I decided to go visit him. I stayed there for a while, came back to fulfill some immigration requirements and went back again. I was waiting for my husband to arrive before occupying myself in anything new. 
        </p>
        <p>After my son was born in 2008, I naturally stepped into the role of a stay-at-home mom. I didn’t have anyone I trusted enough to leave him with ; and honestly, I didn’t want to either. I strongly beleive that the first and most important responsibility of a mother is he kids. No one can care or raise a child like own parents. I never liked leaving my children with others; my children and my family have always been my first priority.
        </p>
        <p>After arriving in American,  just one week before my son's birth, my husband started taking odd jobs to support us. With a master’s degree in IT, he hoped for a professional job, but it just wasn’t happening yet. Still, even with our limited budget, we managed to live a decent, content life. Something I was trained and raised to do my whole life. 
        </p>
        <p>In 2010 and 2014, we welcomed our two daughters, and my world became even more centered around raising them. From that point on, home and family became my full-time focus. I didn’t return to school or work — not until now, as I’m beginning this new chapter.
        </p>
        <p>So when I finally discovered NPower, it felt almost too good to be true. Part of me was excited, and part of me was scared to fall for another scam. But as I learned more about the organization and spoke to real people, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years — hope. And that’s when I decided to give myself a real chance again.I am truly hopeful about NPower. For the first time in years, I feel like I am moving in the right direction. Here, I am learning real, practical skills — HTML, CSS, Java, Git, GitHub, and so much more that I never had access to before. The program also teaches professional development, teamwork, and how the modern IT world works, which is exactly what I needed. Every class makes me feel a little more confident, a little more capable, and a lot more excited about finally stepping into the field I always wanted to be part of.
        </p>
        <p>As I continue this journey, my goal is simple but meaningful: to build a career in IT that I not only succeed in, but truly enjoy. I want to use my skills in a creative way — maybe in web development, software testing, or anything that lets me think, solve problems, and be creative. Most importantly, I want to work in a place where I feel valued and confident, and where my hard-won experiences actually matter. After years of putting my family first, I’m finally giving myself permission to dream again. And with the foundation NPower is helping me build, I believe I can turn those dreams into something real.
